# DendroSearch
A query tool for Ancient Greek Treebanks. Instructions can be found in the user guide. The treebanks included are from the following projects (including some corrections made by Toon Van Hal and me):
* The [Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data), managed by Giuseppe G. A. Celano, Gregory Crane, Bridget Almas and others.
* The [Gorman Trees](https://github.com/perseids-publications/gorman-trees), created by Vanessa Gorman.
* The [Harrington Trees](https://github.com/perseids-project/harrington_trees), managed by J. M. Harrington.
* [Aphthonius' Progymnasmata](https://github.com/polinayordanova/Treebank-of-Aphtonius-Progymnasmata), created by Polina Yordanova.

Any other treebanks (using the AGDT annotation format) can be included by adding them to the xml folder and describing them in the "metadata.xml" file.
